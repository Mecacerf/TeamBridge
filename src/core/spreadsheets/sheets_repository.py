Description: 
    Manages access to the spreadsheet files repository with thread-safe, 
    singleton-like behavior. This module is intended to be used as a 
    globally configured, singleton-style interface, supporting concurrent 
    access from multiple threads.

    It operates on any directory available in the local file system, 
    including network-mounted drives. To improve reliability, it includes 
    a simple retry mechanism to handle temporary unavailability (e.g., due 
    to NAS devices entering sleep mode), and uses locking mechanisms to 
    prevent simultaneous access to the same files.

    It is the responsibility of the user to ensure the file has been acquired
    before saving it or releasing it. Calling these functions without having
    acquiring the file before may cause unexpected behaviors.

    If an error happens during acquired spreadsheet file operations, it is
    normal and intended to not release it. The file will stay unusable until
    someone manually remove the lock file from the remote repository, assuming
    the errors have been manually solved.
